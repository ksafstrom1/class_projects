            <h3>Be Prepared</h3>
            <p>
                The best way to stay safe during tornado season is to prepare ahead of time.
                Know where you’ll go if a tornado warning is issued.
                Keep a flashlight, weather radio, and first aid kit in your designated shelter area.
                Pay close attention to local weather alerts so you can act quickly when needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s also important to wear closed-toe shoes. Tornadoes often occur in warmer months,
                but flip-flops or sandals can leave you vulnerable to sharp debris such as glass or metal fragments.
                Consider keeping a sturdy helmet in your shelter as well—head injuries from flying debris are a leading
                cause of tornado-related deaths.
            </p>

            <p>
                Communication is also critical. Keep a radio, walkie-talkie, or personal alarm with you in case
                you become trapped or need to signal for help. These tools can make it easier for rescuers to locate you
                and ensure you can communicate your condition during or after the storm.
