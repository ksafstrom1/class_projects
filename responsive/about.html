      <h3>Be Prepared</h3>
      <p>
        The best way to stay safe during tornado season is to prepare ahead of time.
        Know where you will go if a tornado warning is issued.
        Keep a flashlight, weather radio, and first aid kit in your designated shelter area.
        Pay close attention to local weather alerts so you can act quickly when needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is also important to wear closed-toe shoes. Tornadoes often occur in warmer months,
        but flip-flops or sandals can leave you vulnerable to sharp debris such as glass or metal fragments.
        Consider keeping a sturdy helmet in your shelter as well, because head injuries from flying debris
        are a leading cause of tornado-related deaths.
      </p>

      <p>
        Communication is critical. Keep a radio, walkie-talkie, whistle, or personal alarm with you in case
        you become trapped or need to signal for help. These tools can make it easier for rescuers to find you
        and help you more quickly during or after the storm.
