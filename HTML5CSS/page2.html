    <h2>What to Do When Tornado Alerts Are Issued</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Be Prepared</h3>
    <p>
      The best way to stay safe during tornado season is to prepare ahead of time. Know where you’ll go if a tornado
      warning is issued. Keep a flashlight, weather radio, and first aid kit in your designated shelter area. Pay close
      attention to local weather alerts so you can act quickly when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s also important to wear closed-toe shoes. Tornadoes often occur in warmer months, but flip-flops or sandals
      can leave you vulnerable to sharp debris such as glass or metal fragments. Consider keeping a sturdy helmet in
      your shelter, as head injuries from flying debris are a leading cause of tornado-related deaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication is also critical. Keep a radio, walkie-talkie, or personal alarm with you in case you become trapped
      or need to signal for help. These tools can make it easier for rescuers to locate you and ensure you can
      communicate your condition during or after the storm.
    </p>

    <h3>During and After the Storm</h3>
    <p>
      If a tornado warning is issued, go immediately to a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor. Stay away
      from windows and doors. In areas such as Tornado Alley, frequent alerts can lead to “warning fatigue,” but it’s
      important to take every alert seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the storm passes, be cautious of hazards like broken glass, downed power lines, and unstable structures. Do
      not leave your shelter until officials announce it is safe to do so. If you’re caught in a vehicle, do
      <em>not</em> seek shelter under an overpass—this advice is outdated and dangerous. Instead, find a low-lying area
      such as a ditch and lie flat to minimize your exposure to flying debris.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it’s safe to do so, check on your neighbors and community members. However, remember to secure your own
      safety first—just as flight attendants instruct passengers to put on their own oxygen masks before helping others.
      Protecting yourself ensures that you’ll be in a position to assist those who need help most.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Stay in a small, windowless room or basement.</li>
      <li>Cover yourself with blankets, pillows, or a mattress.</li>
      <li>Keep a battery-powered radio or weather app nearby.</li>
      <li>Assist neighbors and pets only when it’s safe to do so.</li>
    </ul>
