          <h1>The Early Years of All Star Gyms</h1>
          <p>
            By the late 1980s and 1990s, dedicated cheer gyms began to appear.
            They offered spring floors, tumble tracks, and year-round coaching,
            which helped the sport grow quickly and safely.

            <h2>Growing Competition Culture</h2>
            <p>
              More competition companies entered the scene and events were held in
              arenas and convention centers. Teams traveled across states to compete
              for titles, jackets and bragging rights.

            <h2>Focus on Safety and Rules</h2>
            <p>
              As skills got harder, organizers created rules to control which stunts
              and tumbling passes were allowed at each level. This lowered risk and
              kept routines age appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coaches used progressions, spotting techniques, and drills so athletes
              could move up through levels with a strong foundation.
