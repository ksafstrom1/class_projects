          <h1>The Origins of All Star Cheer</h1>
          <p>
            All star cheer has roots in traditional school and college cheerleading.
            Over time, athletes and coaches wanted a space that focused on skills and performance
            instead of game day sidelines and crowd leading.

            <h2>From Sidelines to Spotlight</h2>
            <p>
              Early cheerleaders led crowds at football and basketball games.
              As stunts and tumbling became more advanced, some teams began
              to compete against each other at local and regional events.

            <h2>The Idea of All Star</h2>
            <p>
              The term all star described athletes who trained in a gym instead of a school.
              These teams focused on routines that combined stunts, tumbling, jumps, and dance
              in a tight two and a half minute routine on a spring floor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Skills were grouped by age and difficulty so younger athletes had a way to grow
              into more advanced levels over time while staying safe.
            </p>
            <p>
              All star cheer is so popular that countries all over the world are creating programs
              for their youth and young adults. Each country adds their own “flavor” to the sport.
