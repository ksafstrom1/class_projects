        <h2>Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale</h2>

                <p>
                    The Enhanced Fujita Scale is used in the United States to rate the strength of tornadoes based on
                    the
                    damag they cause. It helps meteorologists and emergency managers describe how severe a tornado was
                    in a
                    clear
                    andconsistent way.

                <p> <strong> How it all began:</strong>
                    This system of rating was created by Ted Fujita. He studied at the University of Chicago. Ted Fujita
                    first applied his tornado intensity scale during the 1974 Super Outbreak in the Midwest, though he
                    had
                    originally developed it in 1971. He studied the widespread damage from that historic outbreak to
                    classify the strength of individual tornadoes and demonstrate the accuracy of his scale.
                </p>
                <p>Fujita introduced what became known as the F-scale in a 1971 research paper. The system measures a
                    tornado’s intensity by examining the destruction it causes, linking visible damage to estimated wind
                    speeds.
                </p>
                <p>The 1974 Super Outbreak provided the ideal opportunity to test the scale in real-world conditions. By
                    mapping tornado paths and documenting their effects, Fujita was able to confirm that his approach
                    could
                    reliably compare the strength of different storms. </p>

                <p>His method combined aerial photographs, ground-level damage surveys, and eyewitness reports. Using
                    this
                    information, he reconstructed how each tornado formed, traveled, and intensified, helping scientists
                    better understand tornado behavior and refine future forecasting efforts. </p>

                <p><strong>Transition to the EF Scale:</strong>
                    Over time, meteorologists recognized that while Fujita’s original scale was groundbreaking, it had
                    limitations. The estimates of wind speed were based solely on visible damage, which could vary
                    depending
                    on building quality and materials. To improve accuracy, the National Weather Service and a team of
                    engineers and atmospheric scientists developed the Enhanced Fujita, or EF Scale, which replaced the
                    original F-scale in 2007. The EF Scale refined the relationship between wind speed and observed
                    damage,
                    providing more precise estimates while maintaining Fujita’s foundational idea of measuring tornado
                    intensity through its impact on structures and vegetation.
